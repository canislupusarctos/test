<div class="Heading"><h1>Sexual Assault and Harassment</h1></div>

<div class="Subheading"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>

<div class="Content"><body><p><font size="+1">
    This topic is a very serious one, and many people in the world are aware it
    exists, at the very least.  If you aren't one of them, here's the rundown.
    Sexual assault is when anyone, and I mean <b>anyone</b>, is treated in a way
    that violates their boundaries sexually.  Sometimes it is because it isn't 
    consensual, but the victim is ready for sexual actions in a consensual case, 
    and other times because the victim isn't ready for sexual actions in general.
    In any case, sexual assault is no laughing matter.  Even out of those who know
    it exists, many shrug it off as a far less serious problem.  When boys or
    men are sexually assaulted, it is often not taken as seriously, because people
    don't understand, and say that the victim should have been glad they could
    'get laid'.  Being sexually assaulted can ruin a person's life, career, and
    happiness.  In almost all cases, it affects the victim's life forever.  In
    some cases, and almost all the cases publicly known, the assault goes as far 
    as rape, however, sexual assault is not just rape.</font></p></div>
    
    <div class="Content1"><p><font size="+1">Even catcalling at a middle school 
    can be considered a minor form of sexual harassment.  Even that much can be
    enough to make people uncomfortable, yet they are told to get over it, ignore
    it, etc.  But that advice isn't typically the right advice.  It's hard to
    ignore, can make someone feel threatened,especially considering the cases of
    people being raped or killed, and it can cause them to resent society, or 
    maybe even become depressed.  All in all, sexual assault is a serious issue 
    perpetuated in modern day society that must be dealt with.  On this website,
    you'll find resources, information, surveys to help those with knowledge on 
    this topic figure out what they need to be educating people about, and even
    recommendations on what to do to help, or what to do if you are a victim.

<div class="Paragraph3"><div class="Content"><body><p><font size="+1">To ensure this issue is taken seriously, and not thought of as a joke,
    I'll put forth the most alarming statistics first.  Each <b>day</b>, over
    570 people, human beings like everyone else on this planet, who did nothing
    to deserve it, experience sexual violence in the United States <b>alone</b>.
    That's right, almost 600 human beings experience sexual violence at the hands
    of others of the same species every day, in one country <b>alone</b>.  How many
    experience this every day in the world?  Surely many more.  As if this isn't
    troubling enough, ninety-nine percent of sexual violence perpetrators will
    walk free after committing the crime of sexual violence.  Over half of trans
    people will be the victims of sexual violence of some kind in their lives. 
    One sixth of American women have endured, and survived, a rape attempt or
    been raped.  We have also created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/sfusd.edu/presentation/d/15vy9-v9qfPZa7O2Z9ni_7vfY6mJJQ0UW26KPw3FWr-Y/edit?usp=sharing">slideshow</a>
    concerning sexual assault and sexual harassment.
